        <p>
          At 25, with a master’s degree in a completely different field, I found myself pulled toward something new—something that combined logic, creativity, and constant learning: programming.

          I started my journey with Python on Udemy. What began as curiosity quickly turned into a daily habit. I spent hours watching tutorials, writing code, and building small projects just to see what I could create. Python opened the door, but I didn’t stop there. I began exploring HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other languages, slowly building up a toolkit and understanding how the pieces fit together.

          I don’t have formal experience in tech yet, but I’m treating every day like training for it. I’m constantly learning, coding, and pushing myself to improve. I know the path won’t be easy—but I’m not afraid of the work. I’m excited about the journey and even more excited about the chance to grow into a role where I can contribute, learn from others, and build real things that matter.
